# Real time polling app

This project was built to explore the real-time capabilities of **Socket.IO** with **Express.js**.  
It’s a simple web app where multiple users can vote simultaneously, and the results update instantly across all connected clients.

## Features

- Real-time updates using WebSockets (via Socket.IO)
- Simple and minimal frontend (HTML + Vanilla JS)
- Built with Express.js as the backend server

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Socket.IO**
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**

## Future Ideas

- Allow only one vote per client

- Add charts for visual results

- Store votes in a database

- Admin dashboard for resetting polls

## Installation and usage

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

- Now open the link provided on the console and test it
